# üó≥Ô∏è Money formatting

## 1 Amount formatting

### 1.1 Order of magnitude symbols

You can use suffixes after the amount to specify if you want the amount to be parsed as thousands, millions, trillions or quadrillions.\
By default it is:\
\- `k` for thousands\
\- `m` for millions\
\- `b` for billions\
\- `t` for trillions\
\- `q` for quadrillions

So 10k will be 10000 and 0.1m will be 100000

### 1.2 Percentage formatting

You can also use `%` symbol to send money based on your total balance or based on the balance of the recipient

Examples:\
`/pay <target> 10%` will send 10% of your total balance to \<target> player\
`/balance <target> vault give 10%` will give \<target> 10% of his current balance

## 2 DecimalFormatting

This is for displaying decimal numbers on balances or payments

As you can see inside [currency-settings.md](multiple-currencies-with-offline-payments/currency-settings.md "mention") section there is a default [DecimalFormat ](https://www.baeldung.com/java-decimalformat)for every currency

Inside [placeholders.md](../features/placeholders.md "mention") section is explained how to use [DecimalFormat ](https://www.baeldung.com/java-decimalformat)to have a custom output with placeholders
