# ðŸ¥‡ Multiple currencies with offline payments

## Other plugins will use the "vault" currency (or the defined default one) through VaultAPI

_It is not possible to delete the vault currency: it is the default one_

**All currencies are Vault's Economy instances**\
(only the default one is registered into Vault economy service tho)

### All currencies support offline payments!

You can pay your friends when they're offline.\
For developers: you can withdraw or deposit money using the UUID of a player and nothing else!

**You can charge a fee on payments sent!!**
